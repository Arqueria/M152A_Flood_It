2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net select_module/E[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin select_module/led_reg[3]_i_1/O, cell select_module/led_reg[3]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net select_module/E[1] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin select_module/led_reg[4]_i_1/O, cell select_module/led_reg[4]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net select_module/E[2] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin select_module/led_reg[5]_i_1/O, cell select_module/led_reg[5]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#4 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net select_module/E[3] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin select_module/led_reg[6]_i_1/O, cell select_module/led_reg[6]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#5 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net select_module/E[4] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin select_module/led_reg[7]_i_1/O, cell select_module/led_reg[7]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>
